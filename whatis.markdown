title: What is Shellcode?
---
A **shellcode** is a piece of code that is used in exploiting vulnerabilities in software. The shellcode, also called **payload**, is inputted into software and is used to execute arbitrary code of the attacker’s choice.

Shellcode is usually used in conjunction with other techniques such as smashing the stack and return oriented programming to pass the execution to the attacker’s code. It is called shellcode as it is usually used to spawn a shell(**shell out**) from within the process which is then used by the attacker.
